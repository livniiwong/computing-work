~~ hello ~~ 
Ms Lim,
I'm happy that you're my teacher;
I enjoy each lesson you teach.
As my role model you inspire me
To dream and to work and to reach.
You are the best teacher in the world.

With your kindness you get my attention;
Every day you are planting a seed
Of curiosity and motivation
To know and to grow and succeed.

You help me fulfill my potential;
I'm thankful for all that you've done.
I admire you each day, and I just want to say,
As a teacher, you're number one!

You have taught historical concepts well to us well.
You had taught us to infer from the source.
You are always patient in rectifying our mistakes.
Thank you!

A teacher is like Spring,
Who nurtures new green sprouts,
Encourages and leads them,
Whenever they have doubts.

A teacher is like Summer,
Whose sunny temperament
Makes studying a pleasure,
Preventing discontent.

A teacher is like Fall,
With methods crisp and clear,
Lessons of bright colors
And a happy atmosphere.

A teacher is like Winter,
While it's snowing hard outside,
Keeping students comfortable,
As a warm and helpful guide.

Teacher, you do all these things,
With a pleasant attitude;
You're a teacher for all seasons,
And you have my gratitude!

What we learn forms the filter
through which we view the world.
What we learn
determines how we live our lives.
Some teachers teach us the right things
and make them easy to understand.
Some teachers make learning fun,
a joy that enriches all we do.
Some teachers help lead us
toward success and happiness.
Some teachers are very important to us;
we will always remember them.
You are one of those teachers.
Thank you for being my teacher.
I really appreciate you!
